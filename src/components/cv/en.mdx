<h2 className="!mt-2">About</h2>

In my **5 years** of experience as a web developer (mostly **frontend**), I have specialized in the **React** ecosystem and type-safe development with **TypeScript**.
Besides my frontend skills, I have a solid understanding of **backend** development, particularly in integrating and communicating between frontend and backend via **REST APIs**.

My passion for web development drives me to stay constantly updated on the latest technologies and best practices in the industry.

I enjoy exploring new technologies and frameworks to create **modern and efficient user experiences** (**Astro**, **shadcn/ui**, **TanStack**, **tRPC**, ...).
